Predicting severity of the accidents

Here I dealt with accidents in VA.

Introduction Traffic accidents are major source of death, injuries and damage to public property. And accidents are also cause of traffic congestion and delay. So, reducing traffic accidents is an important public safety challenge. There are many analysis and prediction on accidents data. But these studies were not that effective because the data are of limited coverage, either private or old, doesn't include environmental stimuli details etc. So, US accidents is a country wide dataset that has recorded accidents in 49 states from February 2016 to March 2019. It has 2.25 million records of data with 49 attributes. The data is collected from API's like Bing, MapQuest and MapQuest-Bing. Each accident is recorded over many intrinsic and extrinsic attributes like location, weather, Point Of Interest, time, day, natural language description, severity etc.

Objectives

•Identifying the major cause of accidents (weather conditions (wind, humidity, snow etc), traffic rules violation etc). From, this we can study the impact of wind or other environmental stimuli on accidents. So, we can alert people whenever weather conditions are going bad.

•Identifying the Point Of Interest i.e., at which place accidents are occurring majorly i.e., near amenities, crossing, bump, junction etc. From, this we can limit the speed at those particular place and warn people.

•Identifying what are the reasons of high severity accidents.

•Identifying during which months and days accidents are frequent.

•Identifying accident hotspot locations.

•Identifying the threshold values of temperature, wind or visibility beyond which accidents are occurring.

•Predicting the severity, POI of the accidents using Machine Learning technique and comparing their accuracies.
